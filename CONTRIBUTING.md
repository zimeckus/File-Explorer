# Contributing Guidelines
Not much to be said here but please follow a few basic guidelines before making a PR:
- Comment on an issue and gain approval before working on it so we can assign you, otherwise duplicate PRs will keep occuring - you may ping a maintainer (or conaticus) to gain approval
- We might remove you from an issue if you have not worked on it or we have not heard from you when pinging you
- Ensure you base the PR in the `dev` branch, not the `main` branch
- Maintain the coding practises & style used in the current code base

Thanks for reading the guidelines and happy contributing!
